**Dr. Wenyi Jin** is a surgeon from the Department of Orthopedics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. He is a Young Editorial Board Member of iMeta and Traditional Medicine Research and has also served as a reviewer for *Seminars in Cancer Biology, iMeta, Frontiers in immunology, etc*. His work has been published in many reputable journals, including *Carbohydrate Polymers, Theranostics, etc*. Additionally, he has been awarded many awards, such as the Wuhan University Academic Innovation Award and the National Scholarship. Currently, he is working on precision therapies for refractory diseases, with a specific interest in machine learning/bioinformatics, nanomaterials, and precision oncology.


Dr. Jin's team is dedicated to dissecting the complex molecular interaction networks involved in the evolution of cancer. By integrating graph-based contrast learning, graph neural networks, deep learning, and advanced bioinformatics, they could map the molecular interaction atlas of human cancer with unprecedented details, predict unknown essential oncogenic gene pairs, and develop targeted nanotherapeutics.
