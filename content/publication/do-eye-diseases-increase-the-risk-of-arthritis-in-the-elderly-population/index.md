abstract: "There are very few longitudinal studies which have previously
  conducted an investigation into whether eye diseases are a risk for arthritis,
  and how this occurs. The study employed a variety of machine-learning
  algorithms, including random forest for investigating the risks, and to
  elucidate these underlying mechanisms by focusing on five aspects containing
  389 characterized variables (mental health and wellbeing; physical health;
  disability, functional impairment and helpers; health behavior; and health
  measures). The study population included 8,423 individuals. Cataracts,
  glaucoma, and other eye diseases increase the likelihood of arthritis after
  two years by 131.8% (odds ratio (OR)=2.318, 95% confidence interval: 1.748 to
  3.038), 123.1% (OR=2.231, 1.306 to 3.626), and 91.1% (OR=1.911, 1.501 to
  2.415). Random forest corroborated that cataract contributes the most to
  arthritis risks after two years, followed by other eye diseases and glaucoma
  (mean Gini-index: 5.20, 2.11, 1.31). It is of note that the potential
  mechanisms of cataract-induced arthritis risk were elucidated extensively. The
  control domains of life quality, negative aging self-perceptions, mobility
  (steadiness, physical limitations, and muscle strength) and memory
  impairments, and sleep quality mediated the relationship between cataracts and
  arthritis significantly. Furthermore, different eye diseases affected
  osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other arthritis to varying degrees.
  Eye diseases increased the risk of arthritis, whereby cataracts were the most
  significant. Interventions which target these discovered mechanisms may be the
  preferred levers for reducing cataract-related arthritis risk."
