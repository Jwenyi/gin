  Rationale:

  Neuroblastoma (NBL) progression is dependent on the synergic reprogramming of metabolic signaling, which is emerging as a hallmark of malignancy. It is of great clinical significance to develop a specialized risk prognostication approach and explore more effective therapeutic options for NBL based on the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming.

  Methods: 

  With a machine learning-based multi-step program, 946 clinical NBL samples and 470 compounds were analyzed to develop and independently validate a promising metabolic reprogramming-associated prognostic signature (MPS) and individualized treatment based on MPS stratification, for improving the current treatments of NBL. The findings were validated using pre-clinical models.

  Results: 

  MPS-identified MPS-I type NBL showed significantly higher activity of metabolic reprogramming than MPS-II counterparts. MPS demonstrated improved accuracy as compared to current clinical characteristics [AUC: 0.915 vs. 0.657 (MYCN), 0.713 (INSS-stage), and 0.808 (INRG-stratification)] in predicting prognosis. AZD7762 and XMD13-2 demonstrated significant therapeutic implications for MPS-I NBL. Etoposide and BMS-754807 were significantly effective against MPS-II NBL. Further biological studies indicated that the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MPS-identified MPS-I human NBL cells (NCLs) have been significantly inhibited by AZD7762 with a lower half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) as compared to MPS-II NCLs. In contrast to their MPS-I counterparts, MPS-II NCLs demonstrated a significant therapeutic response to etoposide. As indicated in the in vivo models, AZD7762 and etoposide significantly inhibited subcutaneous tumorigenesis, proliferation, and pulmonary metastasis in the MPS-I and MPS-II NCL, respectively, and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Using in vitro and in vivo models, it was shown that AZD7762 and etoposide significantly induced apoptosis in the MPS-I and MPS-II NCLs, respectively, via mitochondria-dependent pathways. The unfavorable prognosis of MPS-identified MPS-I NBL was ascribed to multiple factors, including retinoid resistance, downregulated infiltrations of stromal cells, and an immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting inflammatory microenvironment due to metabolic reprogramming.

  Conclusions: 

  This study provides deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming-mediated malignant progression of NBL. It also sheds light on the development of targeted medications guided by the novel precise risk prognostication approaches, which could contribute to a significantly improved therapeutic strategy for NBL.
