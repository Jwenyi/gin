abstract: The prediction of poor ovarian response (POR) for stratified
  interference is a critical clinical issue that has received an increasing
  amount of recent concern. Anthropogenic diagnostic modes remain too simple for
  the handling of actual clinical complexity. Therefore, this study conducted
  extensive selection using models that were derived from a variety of machine
  learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), decision trees, eXtreme
  Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial
  neural networks (ANN) for the development of two models called the COS
  pre-launch model (CPLM) and the hCG pre-trigger model (HPTM) to assess POR
  based on different requirements. The results demonstrated that CPLM
  constructed using ANN achieved the highest AUC result of all the algorithms in
  COS pre-launch (AUC=0.859, C-index=0.87, good calibration), and HPTL
  constructed using random forest was found to be the most effective in hCG
  pre-trigger (AUC=0.903, C-index=0.90, good calibration). It is notable that
  CPLM and HPTM exhibited better performance than common clinical
  characteristics (0.895 [CPLM], and 0.903 [HPTM] in comparison to 0.824
  [anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH)], and 0.799 [antral follicle count (AFC)]).
  Furthermore, variable importance figure elucidated the values of AMH, AFC, and
  E2 level and follicle number on hCG day, which provides important theoretical
  guidance and experimental data for further application. Generally, the CPLM
  and HPTM can offer effective POR prediction for patients who are receiving
  assisted reproduction technology (ART), and has great potential for guiding
  the clinical treatment of infertility.
