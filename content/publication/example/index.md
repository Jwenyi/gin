abstract: Neuroblastoma (NBL) exists in a complex tumor-immune microenvironment.
  Immune cell infiltration and tumor-immune molecules play a critical role in
  tumor development and significantly impact the prognosis of patients. However,
  the molecular characteristics describing the NBL-immune interaction and their
  prognostic potential have yet to be investigated systematically. We first
  employed multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Gene Sets Enrichment
  Analysis and cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA
  transcripts, to identify immunophenotypes and immunological characteristics in
  NBL patient data from public databases and then investigated the prognostic
  potential and regulatory networks of identified immune-related genes involved
  in the NBL-immune interaction. The immunity signature combining nine immunity
  genes was confirmed as more effective for individual risk stratification and
  survival outcome prediction in NBL patients than common clinical
  characteristics (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.819, C-index = 0.718, p <
  .001). A mechanistic exploration revealed the regulatory network of molecules
  involved in the NBL-immune interaction. These immune molecules were also
  discovered to possess a significant correlation with plasma cell infiltration,
  MYCN status, and the level of chemokines and macrophage-related molecules (p <
  .001). A nomogram was constructed based on the immune signature and clinical
  characteristics, which showed high potential for prognosis prediction (AUC =
  0.856, C-index = 0.755, p < .001). We systematically elucidated the complex
  regulatory mechanisms and characteristics of the molecules involved in the
  NBL-immune interaction and their prognostic potential, which may have
  important implications for further understanding the molecular mechanism of
  the NBL-immune interaction and identifying high-risk NBL patients to guide
  clinical treatment.
