abstract: Sphingolipid metabolism (SM) fuels tumorigenesis and the malignant
  progression of osteosarcoma (OS), which leads to an unfavorable prognosis.
  Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying SM in osteosarcoma and
  developing a SM-based prognostic signature could be beneficial in the clinical
  setting. This study included 88 frozen OS samples to recognize the vital
  SM-relevant genes in the development of OS utilizing univariate Cox
  regression. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
  regression analysis was conducted on the SM- relevant genes to minimize the
  risk of overfitting. The prognostic signature was generate utilizing the
  multivariable Cox regression analysis and was verified in the validation
  cohort. Moreover, cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with SM have an
  unfavorable prognosis for OS patients and have been widely studied.
  Resultantly, an SM-based prognostic risk model was established according to
  critical prognostic genes (CBS, GLB1, and HACD1), which had an excellent
  ability to predict the prognosis of OS patients (AUC for the train cohort was
  0.887 and AUC for validation cohort was 0.737). The high-risk OS patients
  identified based on this prognostic signature had significantly poor immune
  microenvironment, indicated by significantly low immune score (mean=216.290 Â±
  662.463), reduced infiltrations of 25 immune cells, including NK cells (LogFC=
  -0.3597), CD8+T cells ((LogFC=-0.2346), Cytolytic activity ((LogFC=-0.1998),
  etc. The immunosuppressive microenvironment could be due to dysregulated SM of
  glycolipids. Further, a nomogram was constructed by integrating the SM-based
  prognostic signature and clinical paraments to facilitate clinical
  application. The nomogram could accurately predict the prognosis of OS
  invalids. Collectively, this study clarified the function of SM in the
  development of OS and helped develop a tool for risk stratification based on
  SM-related genes with application in clinical settings. The results of our
  study will aid in identifying high-risk patients and provide individualized
  treatments.
