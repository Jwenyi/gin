abstract: 'Few longitudinal studies have systematically investigated whether or
  how individual musculoskeletal conditions (IMCs) convey risks for negative
  psychological health outcomes, and approaches to assess such risk in the older
  population are lacking. In this Irish nationally representative longitudinal
  prospective study of 6,715 individuals aged 50 and above, machine learning
  algorithms and various models, including mediation models, were employed to
  elaborate the underlying mechanisms of IMCs leading to depression and to
  develop an IMC-induced negative psychological risk (IMCPR) classification
  approach. Resultantly, arthritis [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.233
  (1.700-2.927)], osteoporosis [1.681 (1.133-2.421)], and musculoskeletal
  chronic pain [MCP, 2.404 (1.838-3.151)] were found to increase the risk of
  depression after 2 years, while fracture and joint replacement did not.
  Interestingly, mediation models further demonstrated that arthritis per se did
  not increase the risk of depression; such risk was augmented only when
  arthritis-induced restrictions of activities (ARA) existed [proportion of
  mediation: 316.3% (ARA of usual), 213.3% (ARA of social and leisure), and
  251.3% (ARA of sleep)]. The random forest algorithm attested that
  osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis, contributed the most to depressive
  symptoms. Moreover, bone mineral density was negatively associated with
  depressive symptoms. Systemic pain contributed the most to the increased risk
  of depression, followed by back, knee, hip, and foot pain (mean Gini-Index:
  3.778, 2.442, 1.980, 1.438, and 0.879, respectively). Based on the
  aforementioned findings, the IMCPR classification approach was developed using
  an interpretable machine learning model, which stratifies participants into
  three grades. Among the IMCPR grades, patients with a grade of "severe" had
  higher odds of depression than those with a "mild" [odds ratio (95% confidence
  interval): 4.055 (2.907-5.498)] or "moderate" [3.584 (2.101-5.883)] grade.
  Females with a "severe" grade had higher odds of depression by 334.0% relative
  to those with a "mild" grade, while males had a relative risk of 258.4%. In
  conclusion, the present data provide systematic insights into the IMC-induced
  depression risk and updated the related clinical knowledge. Furthermore, the
  IMCPR classification approach could be used as an effective tool to evaluate
  this risk.'
