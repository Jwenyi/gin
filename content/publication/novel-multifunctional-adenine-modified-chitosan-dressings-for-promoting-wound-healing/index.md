abstract: Wound healing is a dynamic and intricate process, and newly dressings
  are urgently needed to promote wound healing over the multiple stages. Herein,
  two water-soluble adenine-modified chitosan (CS-A) derivatives were
  synthesized in aqueous solutions and freeze-dried to obtain porous sponge-like
  dressings. The novel derivatives displayed antibacterial activities against S.
  aureus and E. coli. Moreover, CS-A derivatives demonstrated excellent
  hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility, as well as promoted the proliferation
  of the wound cells by shortening the G1 phase and improving DNA duplication
  efficiency. The ability of CS-A sponges to promote wound healing was studied
  in a full-thickness skin defect model. The histological analysis and
  immunohistochemical staining showed that the wounds treated with CS-A sponges
  displayed fewer inflammatory cells, and faster regeneration of epithelial
  tissue, collagen deposition and neovascularization. Therefore, CS-A
  derivatives have potential application in wound dressings and provide new
  ideas for the design of multifunctional biomaterials.
