abstract: "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are typically situated in a
  complex inflammatory and immune microenvironment, which has been reported to
  contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of patients with ccRCC. There would be
  beneficial clinical implications for elucidating the roles of its molecular
  characteristics in the inflammatory microenvironment. This is because it would
  facilitate the development of reliable biomarkers for pre-stratification prior
  to the designation of individualized treatment strategies. In the present
  study, RNA-sequencing data from 607 patients were retrospectively analyzed to
  elucidate the profile of inflammatory molecules. Based on this, an
  inflammatory prognostic signature (IPS) was developed and further validated
  using clinical ccRCC samples. Subsequently, the associated mechanisms in terms
  of the immune microenvironment and molecular pathways were then investigated.
  This proposed IPS was found to exhibit superior accuracy compared with the
  criterion of a good prognostic model for the prediction of patient prognosis
  from ccRCC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
  (AUC)=0.811] in addition to being an independent factor for prognostic risk
  stratification [hazard ratio: 11.73 (95% CI, 26.98-5.10); log-rank test,
  P<0.001]. Pathologically, ccRCC cells identified as high-risk according to
  their IPS presented with a more malignant tumor structure, including
  voluminous eosinophilic cytoplasm, acinar/lamellar/tubular growth patterns and
  atypic nuclei. High-risk ccRCC also exhibited higher infiltration levels by
  four types of immune cells, including T regulatory cells, but lower
  infiltration levels by mast cells. Pathways associated with
  immune-inflammation interaction, including the IL-17 pathway, were found to be
  upregulated in IPS-identified high-risk ccRCC. Furthermore, by combining the
  IPS with clinical factors, an integrated prognostic index was developed and
  validated for increasing the accuracy of patient risk-stratification for ccRCC
  (AUC=0.911). In conclusion, the complex regulatory mechanisms and molecular
  characteristics involved in ccRCC-inflammation interaction, coupled with their
  prognostic potential, were systematically elucidated in the present study.
  This may have important implications in furthering the understanding into the
  molecular mechanisms underlying this ccRCC-inflammation interaction, which can
  in turn be exploited for identifying high-risk patients with ccRCC prior to
  designing their clinical treatment strategy."
